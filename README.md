# PKTSTAT

It's a FreeBSD 4.11 kernel module sketch to compute statistics on P2P IP usage.
Meant as a complement for the FreeBSD ipfw dummynet shaper to manage excessive
P2P traffic.

Do not try to use it, as this version is only a skeytch and it's not intended for production use.

The production version took a slightly different approach but still used a lot of experience learnt by using this raw sketch.
